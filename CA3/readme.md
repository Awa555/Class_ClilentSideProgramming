Assignment Title: Interactive website



Instructions
You are required to create an interactive website with two pages using a combination of HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.



Page 1
For this page, you are going to create a web application for a restaurant to calculate the cost of atleast 5 customer orders.

1. Staff password validator: c reate a password validator, which tests whether or not the staff’s desired password is strong enough. The criteria which must be met in order for a password to be strong enough are as follows:

a. The password must have at least one lowercase letter.

b. The password must have at least one uppercase letter.

c. It must contain one digit and one special character.

d. And it must be at least eight characters long.


2. User generation: you are required to create at least 5 randomly generated user profiles for the customers using JSON data returned from the random user API. You can use the random user API, https://randomuser.me/ to get data for the customers. Your solution should dynamically generate image thumbnails for the customers.


3. Food cost: the application should include a form that will allow the waiter to choose from a range of available menu items. The menu should include starters, main, dessert and drinks. There should be a minimum of 3 items in each category (i.e. 3 starters, 3 mains, etc.). Some of the guests may be vegetarian, so the starters and mains should contain at least 1 vegetarian menu item. Each menu item is an object containing: t he dish name , a short (1 line) description, a suitable variable that indicates whether the dish is vegetarian, and t he cost of the dish . A breakdown of the bill will be returned to the user
showing:

a. the overall bill

b. a summary of each of the costs subdivided by starters, main, dessert and drinks.

c. a comparison of the cost of the vegetarian meals ordered vs the cost of the
non-vegetarian meals–this only needs to be calculated on the starters and mains.
