Client-Side Programming / Programming: OO Approach
Continuous Assessment 3 (CA3)

First CA3 already lost, because when I see VS Code showed to "The git repository at '/Users/awa' has too many active changes, only a subset of Git features will be enabled." then I delete all, and after I lost all my laptop files and I can't use my laptop. 

That was terrible! I didn't recuva files recovery...
